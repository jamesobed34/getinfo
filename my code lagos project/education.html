        <img src="img/waec.jpg" width="20%">
        <p> The West African Examination Council [WAEC] has condemmed the activities of fraudsters in the country.
         The body said their criminal acts were capable of jeoprdizing the performance of gullible candidates in the ongoing WASSCE for private Candidates, 2018-Second series in Nigerias.
         Mr. Demianus Ojijeogu Head Public Affairs in a statement on Wednesday night, lamented that exams written in other countries had been leaked in Nigeria
         He said, "The Council has observed with dismay that past questions were being posted via Whatsapp and criminal websites by fraudulent individuals, which they clain are that of yet to be written papers.</p>
        <p> "for instance, the question paper for Principle of Cost Accounting that was written in Sierra Leone and The Gambia today are been circulated by those criminally minded elements for candidates in Nigeria as Financial Accounting, the paper slated for tomorrow. "The success of our candidates is our major concern and the council wishes is advise all candidates not to fall prey to these fraudsters but rather concentrate on their studies."</p>

        <h3> APGA chieftain calls for scrapping of JAMB</h3>
        <img src="img/jamb.jpg" width="20%">
        <p> The All Progressives Grand Alliance [APGA] chieftain, Dr Chinedu Ekwalo, has called for scrapping of the Joint Admission and Matreculation Board [JAMB], saying it was more of money-making than placement of studenrs.Ekwalo made the call in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria [NAN] on Tuesday when he visited the party's headquaters in Abuja to pick Expression od interest and Nomination forms. According to him JAMB had become more of a revenue generating organisation than an academic chammel for children to fertiary institutions.</p>
        <p> "I want JAMB to be scrapped and the reason is because Nigerian universities put together, has a carring capacity of 600,000 people and every year we have no fewer than two million persons who sit for UTME. Even if universities should absorb more than their capacities, there are are always many who remained without admission and this happens annually. He said that innowation introduced by JAMB had not in any way improved the standard of education in the country. He also said the huge fees the university admission body usually demanded from applicants had devasting effect on poor Nigerians who wanted to go to school but lacked the means.</p>
        <p> "We have to make Nigeria home for our people and one of the ways we can do that is to look into the education system, there is meed to overhaul the system. "This will pave way for a lot of innowations and youths will have the capacity to express their creativity and make the nation better since they are the majority," he added. </p>
