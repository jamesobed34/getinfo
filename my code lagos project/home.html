                DOGARA-APC accuses Speaker of conniving to undermine Buhari's govt
            </h3>
            <h4> APC reacts to speaker Dogara's defection to the PDP</h4>
            <img src="img/1.jpg" width="20%">
            <p> The All Progressive Congress [APC} has accused speaker YAKUBU DOGARA of working to undermine the MUHAMMADU BUHARI led fedral government. Acting APC spokesman YEKINI NABENA, stated this on thursday. Septenber 13 2018 while reacting to dogara's decision to dump the rulling party for the PEOPLE DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDP}
                Nabena describes Dogara as a "paperweight" in his home state Bauchi.
            </p>
            <p> We have received sevaral media requests for a reaction to the purported deflection of the speaker house of representatives HON YAKUBU DOGARA from the APC to one of the opposition political parties as reported in the media. The APC Spokesman said a recent comment by the President Muhammadu Buhari aptly sums weakest people whose senses of expectation do not align with our vision have exicited our party.</p>
            <p> DOGARA'S reported deflection has not come to us as a surprise it was only a matter of time judging by Dogara's anti-party artics in the National Assembly where in connivance with the semate President Bukola Saraki he exploited all available avenues to sabotage and undermine the APC-LED executives </p>
            <p> Dogara's anti-party activities activities which enabled one of the opposition party's sole victory in Bogoro local Government Area during the recent Bauchi South Senatorial bye-election won by the APC is another pointer among several athers.</p>

            <h3> 2019 election Masari pledges 2.5m votes for Buhari</h3>
            <h4> Masari made the pledge in Abuja on Thursday while answering questions from state House correspondents after a closed door meeting with President Muhammaadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa </h4>
            <img src="img/2.jpg" width="20%">
            <p> According to him the people of Katsina are 100 percent behind the president and they will continue to support him even after the election of 2019</p>
            <p><i> We expect based on figures coming out of the registered voters to give him nothing less tham 70-80 percent. We don't have the figures now because they have completed additional registration, we are not talking about the last excercise that led to the election of 2015, and in 2015 he got almost 1.5millio votes from Katsina state.</i></p>
            <p><i> So we expect by 2019 we will be able to give him additional one million making it not less than 2.5million votes.</i></p>
            <p> On the proposed Electoral Offence Commission when operation would help to sanitise and make the election more credible.</p>
            <p> Masari who also spoke on wheather states should adopt direct or indirect primaries, said there was nothing contentious about the matter as the constitution of the governing All Progressive Congress [APC] was very clear about it.</p>
            <p> He started that already the issue had been settled as three states out of the 36 states had opted for the direct primaries.</p>
